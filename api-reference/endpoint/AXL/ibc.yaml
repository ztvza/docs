            key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin
            querying the next page most efficiently. Only one of offset or key

            offset is a numeric offset that can be used when key is unavailable.
            It is less efficient than using key. Only one of offset or key should
            be set.

          description: |-
            count_total is set to true  to indicate that the result set should include
            a count of the total number of items available for pagination in UIs.
            count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored when key
            is set.

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                              A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                              protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                              the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                value in binary format, or produce an error.
                              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                breaking changes.)

                              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                              type.googleapis.com.

                              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                              used with implementation specific semantics.

                          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any;
                              any.PackFrom(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                ...
                              }

                          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                              }

                           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                              foo = Foo(...)
                              any = Any()
                              any.Pack(foo)
                              ...
                              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                any.Unpack(foo)
                                ...

                           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                               if err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }
                               ...
                               foo := &pb.Foo{}
                               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }

                          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                          name "y.z".


                          JSON
                          ====
                          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                "firstName": <string>,
                                "lastName": <string>
                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                              {

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)

                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                          type.googleapis.com.

                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any;
                          any.PackFrom(foo);

                            ...
                          }

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                           foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                            }

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"
                            }

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)

                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);

                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"
                            }

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                              ...
                            }

                            Foo foo = ...;

                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...

                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                                protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                  breaking changes.)

                                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                type.googleapis.com.

                                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                                used with implementation specific semantics.

                            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                                Foo foo = ...;
                                Any any;
                                any.PackFrom(foo);
                                ...
                                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                  ...
                                }

                            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                                Foo foo = ...;
                                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                                ...
                                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                                }

                             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                                foo = Foo(...)
                                any = Any()
                                any.Pack(foo)
                                ...
                                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                  any.Unpack(foo)
                                  ...

                             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                                 if err != nil {
                                   ...
                                 }
                                 ...
                                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                   ...
                                 }

                            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                            name "y.z".


                            JSON
                            ====
                            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                                package google.profile;
                                message Person {
                                  string first_name = 1;
                                  string last_name = 2;
                                }

                                {
                                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                  "firstName": <string>,
                                  "lastName": <string>
                                }

                            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                                {
                                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                                  "value": "1.212s"

                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}

                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                          A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                          type.googleapis.com.

                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}

                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                                In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                  breaking changes.)

                                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                type.googleapis.com.

                                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                                used with implementation specific semantics.

                            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                                Foo foo = ...;
                                Any any;
                                any.PackFrom(foo);
                                ...
                                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                  ...
                                }

                            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                                Foo foo = ...;
                                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                                ...
                                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                                }

                             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                                foo = Foo(...)
                                any = Any()
                                any.Pack(foo)
                                ...
                                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                  any.Unpack(foo)
                                  ...

                             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                                 if err != nil {
                                   ...
                                 }
                                 ...
                                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                   ...
                                 }

                            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                            name "y.z".


                            JSON
                            ====
                            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                                package google.profile;
                                message Person {
                                  string first_name = 1;
                                  string last_name = 2;
                                }

                                {
                                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                  "firstName": <string>,
                                  "lastName": <string>
                                }

                            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                                {
                                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                                  "value": "1.212s"

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"
                            }

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".

                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                          type.googleapis.com.

                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any;
                          any.PackFrom(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                            ...
                          }

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          foo = Foo(...)
                          any = Any()
                          any.Pack(foo)
                          ...
                          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                            any.Unpack(foo)
                            ...

                       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                           if err != nil {
                             ...
                           }
                           ...
                           foo := &pb.Foo{}
                           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                             ...
                           }

                      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                      name "y.z".

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                          package google.profile;

                            string first_name = 1;

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                          type.googleapis.com.

                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.

                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)

                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);

                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                            type.googleapis.com.

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                              A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                              protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                              the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                value in binary format, or produce an error.
                              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                breaking changes.)

                              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                              type.googleapis.com.

                              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                              used with implementation specific semantics.

                          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any;
                              any.PackFrom(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                ...
                              }

                          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                              }

                           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                              foo = Foo(...)
                              any = Any()
                              any.Pack(foo)
                              ...
                              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                any.Unpack(foo)
                                ...

                           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                               if err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }
                               ...
                               foo := &pb.Foo{}
                               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }

                          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                          name "y.z".

                          ====
                          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                "firstName": <string>,
                                "lastName": <string>
                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      breaking changes In these cases, the RevisionNumber is incremented so that

                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                          type.googleapis.com.

                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
                      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any;
                          any.PackFrom(foo);

                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
                        name "y.z".


                        JSON
                        ====
                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"
                            }
